# Scheduler
It is an app that helps you to set a scheduled alarm on another device.

For Example, suppose there are two persons named A and B. A and B both installed this app in their Android phone. 
A can then set a date and time with picture, sound, message etc. and can send it to B. 
When the time and date will come, an alarm containing the sound, picture message etc.
B also can do the same task to A.

**Note: Standard SMS charge is applicable since schedule is set via sending a SMS**

##How Scheduler Works

To get schedule from another person, a user must add the sender/scheduler's phone number to his allowed list. To prevent an anonymous person to set a schedule, this security system is added. 

##Allowed Numbers
To add allowed number simply type the number or select from the contact.

**Note: No one can set schedule expect the numbers in the allowed numbers**

##Add schedule
To add schedule, select date, time picture and sound. There is another option **Receiver's Phone Mode** which can change receiver's phone status to **Silent**, **Vibrate**, **Ringing** or leave the phone status as it was.

After filling the fields simply enter the receiver's phone number click on set button.


**Note: schedule will not be set unless receiver put your phone number to his allowed number list**

##History
History contains the information who set schedule in your device. Also the detail information containing the image, sound, message he used can also be shown.
